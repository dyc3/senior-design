= Balancer Design

== Internal Architecture

) <Figure::balancer-internals-class>

Shown in @Figure::balancer-internals-class is the internal structure of the Balancer. The Balancer will discover Monoiths using the `MonolithDiscoverer` (a process further described in @Chapter::MonolithDiscovery), and the `MonolithConnectionManager` will establish connections to each Monolith. `Balancer` will update `BalancerContext` according to the messages it receives from `BalancerLink`. `Balancer` will then use `BalancerContext` to route messages to the appropriate Monoliths. Clients work similarly, except that they establish connections to the Balancer via `BalancerService`. `BalancerService` handles proxying HTTP requests to the appropriate Monoliths, and also accepting and upgrading WebSocket connections.

== Package Structure

In Rust, packages are called "crates". The Balancer and Harness is split into multiple crates, as seen in @Figure::balancer-crates. The reason for this is that cargo, the Rust package manager, treats crates as the unit of compilation. This means that if you change a single line of code in a crate, the entire crate must be recompiled. By splitting the Balancer into multiple crates, we can reduce the amount of code that needs to be recompiled when a change is made.
