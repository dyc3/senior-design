OpenTogetherTube Load Balancer

*Description*

OpenTogetherTube (OTT) is an open source web application that allows users to watch
videos together in real-time. The nature of the application makes it non-trivial
to scale to a large number of users. To solve this, the team has designed and
implemented a custom load balancer to appropriately handle the needs of the project.
The load balancer allows the application to be deployed around the world, lowering
latency for users, improving reliability, and allowing for a larger number of
simultaneous users.
