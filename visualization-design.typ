= Visualization Design

The visualization serves a dual purpose: To communicate the functionality of the load balancer at a glance to a non-technical audience, and to serve as a useful debugging tool during development.

== Hosting

Due to time constraints, the visualization will be self-hosted on the user's machine. If needed, a subdomain of OpenTogetherTube can be established at a later time.

== Frameworks/Libraries

The visualization must be ready before the innovation exposition on April 26 and is not the main focus of the project. With this in mind, Vue.js and D3.js have been selected for development due to their popularity, ease of use, and low-learning curve.

#figure(
  table(
    columns: 2,
    [*View*],[*Graph Type*],
    [Default], [TBD],
    [Region], [TBD],
    [Latency Graph], [TBD],
    [Traffic Heat Map], [TBD],
    [OTT Traffic/Time], [TBD]
  ),
  caption: "Visualization Views and Graph Type"
)

The names are a WIP.

== Gathering Data

TBD
