== Week Report 1 (09/13/2023) <report-w1>

*What I did this week*

- Wrote up a project description to share with potential team mates
- Search for potential team mates
- Rewrote how balancer-monolith connections work, they now go in the opposite direction (balancer -> monolith) instead of (monolith -> balancer) because it decreases latency when starting up the balancer.
- Finalized team

*Tasks for next week*

- Set up a new repo for the load balancer spec
- Convert load balancer spec from latex to typst
- Update load balancer spec to reflect current implementation
- Determine the best way to do integration tests for the load balancer
- Determine requirements for the load balancer testing harness
- Get dev environment set up for Chris

*Risks*

- Chris is not experienced with Rust which may slow down development
	- Carson will be available to help Chris with Rust
